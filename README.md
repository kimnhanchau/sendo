What I have done:
- Automation Test Exercise #1: finished (2 test cases)
	- add new customer and check created successfully
	- add new account and check created successfully
- Automation Test Exercise #2: finished
	- verify share function works well

Issues:
- Sample POST request was wrong: must be "https", not http
- verifyShareFunction result is failed because total_shares is not increasing
